        MMA styles I: grouping finishes using large-scale data
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2016</span>
    <p>MMA fighters use a mixture of martial arts and the way that they win fights reflects their personal style.</p>

<p>A useful way of understanding the styles of fighters is if we (1) determine the styles of individual fighters and, (2) understand the set of techniques that an individual style entails. To investigate the latter question, rather than assuming that the grouping of techniques was known (such as heel hooks and triangle chokes contributing to a BJJ game), I determined whether such groupings could naturally emerge based on how frequently finishes have been used by the same fighters (i.e. do fighters who win with armbars tend to win with triangle chokes?)</p>

<p>Using data from ~120,000 wins across 35,000 fighters, I determined how frequently each pair of <a href="http://www.fightprior.com/2016/05/05/summarizingFights/">50 common finishes</a> was used by the same fighters relative to chance, allowing me to identify ~300 pairs of finishes that are commonly used together by fighters. These finish pairs can be used to more broadly organize finishes, grouping finishes that share similar partners.</p>

        In MMA winners keep winning and losers keep losing
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2016</span>
    <p>In MMA, momentum is huge. Fighters who continue to extend their win streaks by dominating opponents can quickly work their way up the tables, awarding them the opportunity to fight tougher opponents, move to higher caliber fight organizations and maybe, ultimately win a title shot. On the flip side, it can be hard for fighters to recover from a loss; often a single loss is often a sign that a fighter’s confidence is shaken and their future performance will suffer.</p>

<p>In this post, I address one aspect of momentum in MMA: how a fighter’s performance in one fight affects their performance in their next fight. Summarizing the careers of over 150,000 fighters, I see that wins at any stage of a fighter’s career are an indicator of future success, while early losses are often enough to force a fighter to rethink their MMA dreams.</p>

        Building a large database of MMA fight results IV: turning tables into a database with R and SQL
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2016</span>
    <p>Previously, I discussed acquiring and standardizing a compendium of fighter and fight-level MMA results.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fightprior.com/2016/04/29/scrapingMMA/">I: Scraping fighter and fight data</a>: Aggregating data from ~250,000 MMA fights between ~140,000 fighters.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.fightprior.com/2016/05/13/summarizingFighters/">III: Cleaning up fighter-level data</a>: summarizing where fighters are from and major weight classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post, I will go over how the previously created fight, fighter and event-level tables can be transformed into a MySQL database that can both be created and accessed using R.</p>

        The not-so-small-world network of MMA fighters

    </h2>

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2016</span>
    <p>There are over 140,000 amateur and professional mixed martial artists and the matchups between these fighters are far from random. It seems pretty obvious that <a href="http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Holly-Holm-75125">Holly Holm’s</a> next fight won’t be against <a href="http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Antonio-Silva-12354">Bigfoot Silva</a>, but it is less clear how many reasonable matchups are out there for most fighters.</p>

<p>One way we can think about this question is that fighters will tend to compete against other fighters who are relatively similar to them. An amateur fighter may compete against fighters in his town and in neighboring towns. His opponents may do the same. While this fighter is unlikely to compete against fighters who live two towns over, he can still be said to be relatively closely connected to these fighters because they are only two jumps aways. At a broader scale, MMA fighters who are very different may be many jumps apart, seperated by large geographical barriers or other obstructions.</p>

        Building a large database of MMA fight results III: summarizing the demographics of 140,000 MMA fighters
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2016</span>
    <p>The essential units of analysis in MMA are the sport’s fighters and the bouts between them. In my <a href="http://www.fightprior.com/2016/05/05/summarizingFights/">previous post</a>, I discussed how to standardize match data so that the major categories of finishes could be easily visualized.</p>

<p>In this entry, I will discuss how to clean-up fighter-level data. The main goal of this post will be to determine the factors that affect fighter matchups. For some fighters, our data contains useful demographics, while for other fighters, this information is missing. One goal of this post will be to infer missing demographic data based on fighters’ previous bouts. For example, if we don’t know where in the world a fighter lives, we can probably determine their location with good accuracy if all their fights have been against people from the same region.</p>
